## Cấu hình live migration instance ( volume based ) 

## 1. Mở đầu


- Live migration hỗ trợ các kiểu gồm :
	-   **Shared storage-based live migration**. The instance has ephemeral disks that are located on storage shared between the source and destination hosts.
    
	-   **Block live migration**, or simply block migration. The instance has ephemeral disks that are not shared between the source and destination hosts. Block migration is incompatible with read-only devices such as CD-ROMs and Configuration Drive (config_drive).
    
	-   **Volume-backed live migration**. Instances use volumes rather than ephemeral disks.

- In a multi-cell cloud, instances can be live migrated to a different host in the same cell, but not across cells.

- Cấu hình Nova VNC
```
[vnc]

```




- Cấu hình Libvirtd trên các compute node
```
cp /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf.orig

sed -i 's/#listen_tls = 0/listen_tls = 0/g' /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf

systemctl restart libvirtd
systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute.service
```

- Cấu hình FirewallD trên cacs compute node 
```
